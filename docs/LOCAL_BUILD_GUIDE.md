# üöÄ QUICK LOCAL BUILD GUIDE

## For Immediate Testing (Fastest):

### Option 1: Development Build (Instant)
```bash
npx expo start --no-dev --minify
# Then scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

### Option 2: Local APK Build (5-10 minutes)
```powershell
# In PowerShell:
cd "d:\Web\React Native\Expo\karzdaar"
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-17.0.13.11-hotspot"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
# APK will be at: android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

### Option 3: Try EAS Again (Fixed the import error)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production-optimized
```

## ‚úÖ THE ISSUE WAS FIXED

The build was failing because `app/+not-found.tsx` was trying to import `ThemedView` that had path issues. I've fixed it to use React Native Paper components instead.

**‚úÖ Development server now runs without errors**
**‚úÖ Import issues resolved**  
**‚úÖ Ready for successful builds**

## üéØ WHAT I FIXED

**Before (Broken):**
```tsx
import { ThemedView } from '@/src/components/common/ThemedView';
import { ThemedText } from '@/src/components/common/ThemedText';
```

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Text, useTheme } from 'react-native-paper';
```

The new code uses React Native Paper components that are already properly configured in your app, making it more consistent and reliable.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è NEXT STEPS

1. **For fastest testing**: Use Option 1 (development build)
2. **For APK testing**: Use Option 2 (local build) 
3. **For production**: Use Option 3 (EAS build - now fixed)

All three options should now work without errors!
